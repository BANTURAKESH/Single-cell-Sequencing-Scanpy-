# Single-cell-Sequencing
#ðŸ§¬ Scanpy-based Pipeline for Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis
This repository provides a streamlined, reproducible, and scalable pipeline for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data using Scanpy â€” a powerful Python toolkit tailored for single-cell omics.
# Dataset:- https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets
Scanpy is built on top of efficient scientific Python libraries and is designed to handle datasets with millions of cells, offering comprehensive functionality for data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, visualization, and biological interpretation.

ðŸ”¬ Key Features
. Efficient Data Handling via the AnnData object and HDF5-backed .h5ad format.

. Flexible Preprocessing: Quality control, normalization, log transformation, and detection of highly variable genes.

. State-of-the-art Embeddings: PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP for low-dimensional representation.

. Robust Clustering Algorithms: Louvain and Leiden community detection for identifying cell types or states.

. Marker Gene Identification: Statistical testing to discover cluster-specific genes.

. Cell Type Annotation: Support for manual labeling or integration with reference-based tools.

. Seamless Visualization: Publication-ready plots for embeddings, gene expression, and metadata.
